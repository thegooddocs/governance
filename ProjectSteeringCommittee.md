PSC members may retire any time. If a PSC member becomes inactive, for multiple quarters, it may time to retire. (Ex-members will typically be welcomed back if they become active again.) An inactive member may be invited to retire. If unresponsive they may be removed by the existing PSC.

## Decisions

Decisions are based on voting using the following:

-   +1 : For
-   +0: Mildly for, but mostly indifferent
-   0: Indifferent
-   -0: Mildly against, but mostly indifferent
-   -1 : Strongly against. This is expected to be accompanied by a
    reason.

For most decisions, a motion is raised within one of TheGoodDocsProject open forums (slack, email list, etc) and those present vote and decide. Should a decision:

-   Be strategic or impact many within TheGoodDocsProject,
-   Or if there is contention in deciding, and after discussion at least one member is still strongly against the motion, by continuing to vote -1,

Then the motion should be referred to the PSC.

For motions presented to the PSC, a motion is considered passed when there are more PSC +1 votes than -1 votes, and either all PSC members have voted, or 4 days have passed. In the case of a tie, the PSC chair shall have 1.5 votes.

## Expectations of PSC members

-   Regularly contribute to TheGoodDocsProject or related activities
-   Help with whatever dirty work is required to keep the project moving forward
-   Monitor TheGoodDocsProject conversations, either in weekly meetings, or on the email list, and contribute constructively where appropriate
-   Vote promptly (within days) to motions being raised
